python-openhmd
===========
Changes were made based on this commit:

https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD/commit/2a3b34b61298a63cab72c9b3d4f665088a329204

This build is untested.


This failed when trying to build with libopenhmd-dev and libopenhmd0 due to the header file, /usr/include/open
hmd/openhmd.h being different then the header file installed when building from source.
